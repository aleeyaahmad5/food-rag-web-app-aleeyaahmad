This leavened bread is made from a dough of all-purpose flour, yogurt, and yeast that is allowed to rise before being stretched and slapped against the scorching walls of a clay tandoor oven where it bakes in mere minutes. The yogurt tenderizes the dough while adding subtle tang, and the high heat of the tandoor creates the characteristic leopard-spotted char that makes naan so distinctive.
