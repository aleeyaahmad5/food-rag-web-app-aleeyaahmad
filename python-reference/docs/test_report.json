      "answer": "Based on the provided context, slow-cooked tender meals include:\n\n1. Haleem (slow-cooked meat and lentil stew)\n2. Paella (Spanish rice dish)\n   - Paella is not a slow-cooked tender meal in the traditional sense, but it does involve a long simmering time to form the crust called socarrat.\n\nHowever, considering the question's focus on 'slow-cooked tender meals,' Haleem is a more prominent example of a dish that perfectly matches the description.\n\n3. Risotto (Italian rice dish) - While risotto does not have an extremely long cooking time compared to Haleem, it is a slow-cooked dish, but not traditionally slow-cooked like Haleem.",

      "answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems like you're looking for information about raw or fresh preparations related to the mentioned dishes. However, since 'Haleem' is a slow-cooked dish, it's unlikely to have a fresh raw preparation. But here are some options from the other mentioned dishes:\n\nFor Laksa, a fresh raw preparation might be the raw ingredients like vegetables, such as bean sprouts, bok choy, or cucumbers, that can be added to the noodle soup at the end of cooking. \n\nFor Hangi, since it's a traditional Māori method of cooking, I couldn't find much information on fresh raw preparations directly associated with it. However, some Māori dishes might include raw ingredients like raw fish or raw vegetables.\n\nFor the context as a whole, you might also consider naan bread, which is typically served fresh and raw.",
